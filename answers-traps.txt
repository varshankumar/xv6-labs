1. Registers a0 though a7 contain arguments to functions. 
Register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.

2. The call to function f is calculated by the compiler and put into register a1.
26:	45b1                	li	a1,12
Similarly, the compiler puts the function content in the code for f. 
14:	250d                	addiw	a0,a0,3

3. Function printf is located at address 642.

4. The register ra contains the return address (38) just after the jalr to printf in main. 

5. The output is "He110 World"

6. The code will not compile because a second argument is not given.
